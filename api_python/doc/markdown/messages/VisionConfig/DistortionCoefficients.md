# class DistortionCoefficients

 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|k1|float|First radial distortion coefficient|You can manipulate the field k1 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of k1 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|k2|float|Second radial distortion coefficient|You can manipulate the field k2 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of k2 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|k3|float|Third radial distortion coefficient|You can manipulate the field k3 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of k3 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|p1|float|First tangential distortion coefficient|You can manipulate the field p1 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of p1 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|p2|float|Second tangential distortion coefficient|You can manipulate the field p2 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of p2 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
