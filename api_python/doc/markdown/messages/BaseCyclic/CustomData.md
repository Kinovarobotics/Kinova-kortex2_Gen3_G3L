# class CustomData

 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|frame\_id|int|Frame ID|You can manipulate the field frame\_id as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of frame\_id and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|custom\_data\_0|int|Custom data word 0|You can manipulate the field custom\_data\_0 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of custom\_data\_0 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|custom\_data\_1|int|Custom data word 1|You can manipulate the field custom\_data\_1 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of custom\_data\_1 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|custom\_data\_2|int|Custom data word 2|You can manipulate the field custom\_data\_2 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of custom\_data\_2 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|custom\_data\_3|int|Custom data word 3|You can manipulate the field custom\_data\_3 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of custom\_data\_3 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|custom\_data\_4|int|Custom data word 4|You can manipulate the field custom\_data\_4 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of custom\_data\_4 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|custom\_data\_5|int|Custom data word 5|You can manipulate the field custom\_data\_5 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of custom\_data\_5 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|custom\_data\_6|int|Custom data word 6|You can manipulate the field custom\_data\_6 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of custom\_data\_6 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|custom\_data\_7|int|Custom data word 7|You can manipulate the field custom\_data\_7 as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of custom\_data\_7 and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|actuators\_custom\_data| [ActuatorCustomData](ActuatorCustomData.md#)|Actuator custom data \(repeated\)|Repeated message fields are represented as an object that acts like a Python sequence. However, You must use add\(\) instead of append\(\). It also has an extend\(\) function that appends an entire list of messages, but makes a copy of every message in the list.|
|interconnect\_custom\_data| [CustomData](../InterconnectCyclic/CustomData.md#)|Interconnect custom data|To set interconnect\_custom\_data, you simply assign a value directly to a field within interconnect\_custom\_data. You can also use the parent message's HasField\(\) method to check if a message type field value has been set.|
