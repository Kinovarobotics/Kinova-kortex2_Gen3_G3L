 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|mode|int|Operational mode of the sensor|You can manipulate the field mode as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of mode and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|threshold\_a|float|Sensitivity of the sensor A \(0-100%\).|You can manipulate the field threshold\_a as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of threshold\_a and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|threshold\_b|float|Sensitivity of the sensor B \(0-100%\).|You can manipulate the field threshold\_b as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of threshold\_b and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
