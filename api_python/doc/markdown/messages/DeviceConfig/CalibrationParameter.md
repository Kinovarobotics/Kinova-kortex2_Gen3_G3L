# class CalibrationParameter

 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|calibration\_parameter\_identifier|int|Calibration parameter identifier|You can manipulate the field calibration\_parameter\_identifier as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of calibration\_parameter\_identifier and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|signedIntValue|oneof:value int|Signed int calibration value.|You can manipulate the field signedIntValue as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of signedIntValue and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface. The message class also has a WhichOneof method that lets you find out which field \(if any\) in the oneof has been set.|
|unsignedIntValue|oneof:value int|Unsigned int calibration value.|You can manipulate the field unsignedIntValue as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of unsignedIntValue and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface. The message class also has a WhichOneof method that lets you find out which field \(if any\) in the oneof has been set.|
|floatValue|oneof:value float|Float calibration value.|You can manipulate the field floatValue as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of floatValue and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface. The message class also has a WhichOneof method that lets you find out which field \(if any\) in the oneof has been set.|
