 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|port\_id|int|UART port identification|You can manipulate the field port\_id as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of port\_id and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|enabled|bool|True if UART device is enabled, false otherwise|You can manipulate the field enabled as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of enabled and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
