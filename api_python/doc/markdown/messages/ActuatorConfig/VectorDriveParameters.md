# class VectorDriveParameters

 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|kpq|float|Quadrature axis current proportional gain|You can manipulate the field kpq as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of kpq and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|kiq|float|Quadrature axis current integral gain|You can manipulate the field kiq as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of kiq and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|kpd|float|Direct axis current proportional gain|You can manipulate the field kpd as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of kpd and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|kid|float|Direct axis current integral gain|You can manipulate the field kid as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of kid and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
