# class KinematicTrajectoryConstraints

 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|angular\_velocities|float|Angular velocities for each actuator \(in deg/s\)|You can manipulate the field angular\_velocities as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of angular\_velocities and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|linear\_velocity|float|Linear velocity \(in m/s\)|You can manipulate the field linear\_velocity as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of linear\_velocity and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|angular\_velocity|float|Angular velocity \(in deg/s\)|You can manipulate the field angular\_velocity as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of angular\_velocity and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
