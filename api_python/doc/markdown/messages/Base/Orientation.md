|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|theta\_x|float|Theta X orientation \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field theta\_x as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of theta\_x and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|theta\_y|float|Theta Y orientation \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field theta\_y as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of theta\_y and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|theta\_z|float|Theta Z orientation \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field theta\_z as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of theta\_z and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
