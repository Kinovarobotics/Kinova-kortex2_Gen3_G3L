 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|linear\_x|float|Linear X velocity \(m/s or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field linear\_x as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of linear\_x and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|linear\_y|float|Linear Y velocity \(m/s or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field linear\_y as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of linear\_y and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|linear\_z|float|Linear Z velocity \(m/s or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field linear\_z as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of linear\_z and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|angular\_x|float|Angular X velocity \(deg/s or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field angular\_x as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of angular\_x and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|angular\_y|float|Angular Y velocity \(deg/s or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field angular\_y as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of angular\_y and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|angular\_z|float|Angular Z velocity \(deg/s or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field angular\_z as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of angular\_z and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
