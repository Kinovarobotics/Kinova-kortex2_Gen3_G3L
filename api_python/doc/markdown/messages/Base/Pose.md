 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|x|float|X position \(in meters\)|You can manipulate the field x as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of x and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|y|float|Y position \(in meters\)|You can manipulate the field y as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of y and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|z|float|Z position \(in meters\)|You can manipulate the field z as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of z and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|theta\_x|float|Theta X orientation \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field theta\_x as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of theta\_x and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|theta\_y|float|Theta Y orienation \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field theta\_y as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of theta\_y and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|theta\_z|float|Theta Z orientation \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field theta\_z as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of theta\_z and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
