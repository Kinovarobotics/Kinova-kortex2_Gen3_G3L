# class PreComputedJointTrajectoryElement

 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|joint\_angles|float|Angles values for all joints \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field joint\_angles as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of joint\_angles and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|joint\_speeds|float|Speed values for all joints \(in degrees per second\)|You can manipulate the field joint\_speeds as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of joint\_speeds and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|joint\_accelerations|float|Acceleration values for all joints \(in degrees per second^2\)|You can manipulate the field joint\_accelerations as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of joint\_accelerations and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|time\_from\_start|float|Absolute elaspsed time since initial point \(in seconds\)|You can manipulate the field time\_from\_start as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of time\_from\_start and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
