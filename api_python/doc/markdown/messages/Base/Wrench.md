# class Wrench

 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|force\_x|float|Linear X force \(Newtons or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with Joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field force\_x as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of force\_x and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|force\_y|float|Linear Y force \(Newtons or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with Joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field force\_y as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of force\_y and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|force\_z|float|Linear Z force \(Newtons or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with Joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field force\_z as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of force\_z and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|torque\_x|float|Angular X torque \(Newton-meters or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with Joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field torque\_x as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of torque\_x and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|torque\_y|float|Angular Y torque \(Newton-meters or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with Joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field torque\_y as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of torque\_y and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|torque\_z|float|Angular Z torque \(Newton-meters or ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 if used with Joystick command\)|You can manipulate the field torque\_z as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of torque\_z and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
