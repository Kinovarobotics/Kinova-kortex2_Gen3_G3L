# class CartesianTransform

 **Member values** 

|Member name|Data type|Description|Usage|
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
|x|float|x \(in meters\)|You can manipulate the field x as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of x and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|y|float|y \(in meters\)|You can manipulate the field y as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of y and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|z|float|z \(in meters\)|You can manipulate the field z as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of z and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|theta\_x|float|Theta x \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field theta\_x as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of theta\_x and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|theta\_y|float|Theta y \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field theta\_y as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of theta\_y and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
|theta\_z|float|Theta z \(in degrees\)|You can manipulate the field theta\_z as if it were a regular field. To clear the value of theta\_z and reset it to the default value for its type, you call the ClearField\(\) method of the Message interface.|
